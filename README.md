# Practice JS project - Todo App

* Used Bootstrap for styling
* Writted with raw JS
* Have add, edit & delete function
* Have function to check statuses of todo items

# Note:

During the working period, I have found some interesting JS functions like:
* [Element.insertAdjacentHTML()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML): parses the specified text as HTML or XML and inserts the resulting nodes into the DOM tree at a specified position.
* [Element.querySelectorAll()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll): returns all elements descended from the element on which it is invoked that matches the specified group of CSS selectors, very useful to use with `forEach` function to loop through DOM tree, better than `getElementsByClassName` in my opinion.
* [Element.ParentNode()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode): to get parent node of an element in DOM tree.
